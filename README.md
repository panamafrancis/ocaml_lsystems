# ocaml_lsystems
Lindemayer systems implemented in OCaml

Goals for this project are:
 - Parametric and perhaps context sensitive l-system support
 - Use as a basis for a distributed computational evolution project, where individuals are fractals

Initially I want to learn how to write "production" OCaml and go deeper into functional programming

To build with tests

    ocaml setup.ml -configure --enable-tests
    make
    make test
